This chapter will examine*\nthe increasing impact of a growing international network on Africa roughly in the period\nM between 1200 and 1600 c.z. The arrival of Islam, after 800 -\u00a2.2., had transformed many\naspects of life in some African societies and brought them into wider contacts through\nj trade, politics, and cultural exchange. But we must also recognize that the African societies\ninfluenced by Islam often maintained their own traditions and that other African regions\nremained little touched by Islam and continued to develop along their own trajectories.\nIt is also important to realize that interactions with North Africa and the Middle East did\nnot extend to direct encounters with the great Mongol Empire during this crucial period.\nAfrican civilizations built somewhat less clearly on prior societies than did other\ncivilizations around 1200. Some earlier themes, such as the Bantu migration and the\n, formation of large states in the Western Sudan, noted in Chapter 2, persisted. Overall,\nsub-Saharan Africa remained a varied and distinctive setting; parts of it, like the port\ncities of the East African coast, were drawn into new contacts with the growing world\nnetwork, but much of it retained a certain isolation or cultural autonomy. The spread of\nuniversal faiths like Islam and Christianity was an important asp\u00e9ct of African history in\nthis period, but much of Central and Southern Africa was relatively unaffected by these\noutside influences.\n\n\n--- End of Page 2 ---\n| African Societies: Diversity and\nilarities\n\n\u00a2 were the main political and religious forms in sub-Saharan Africa, and what\nysome of the principal regional patterns?\n\ntinent\u2014the world\u2019s second largest\u2014Africa is so vast and its societies so diverse\nis almost impossible to generalize about them.",

Still, decen.\ntralized societies found it difficult to resist external pressures, mobilize for warfare, oy.\nganize large building projects, or create stable conditions for continuous long-distance\ntrade with other peoples. All these needs or goals contributed to the formation of states\nin sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nState-building took place under a variety of conditions. For example, West Africa ex-\nperienced both the cultural influence of Islam and its own internal developments. The\nformation of some powerful states, such as Mali and Songhay, depended more on milj-\ntary power and dynastic alliances than on ethnic or cultural unity. In this development\nand in the process of state formation itself, Africa paralleled the roughly contemporane-\nous developments of Western Europe. The growth of city-states with strong merchant\ncommunities in West Africa and on the Indian Ocean coast bore certain similarities to the\nurban developments of Italy and Germany in this period. However, disparities between |\nthe technologies and ideologies of Europeans and Africans also created differences in the\nways these societies developed.

The spread of the Bantu-speaking peoples\nprovided a linguistic base across much of Africa, so that even though specific languages\ndiffered, structure and vocabulary allowed some mutual understanding between neigh-\nboring Bantu speakers. .\n\nThe same might be said of the animistic religion that characterized much of Africa.\nFrom the continent's earliest beginnings people held a belief that a soul or spirit existed\nin every object, even if it was inanimate. In a future state this soul or spirit would exist\nas part of an immaterial soul. The spirit, therefore, was thought to be universal. Africans,\nlike Europeans, believed that some evil, disasters, and illnesses were produced by witch-\ncraft. Specialists were needed to combat the power of evil and eliminate the witches. This\nled in many societies to the existence of a class of diviners or priests who guided reli-\ngious practice and helped protect the community. Above all, African religion provided\na cosmology\u2014a view of how the universe worked\u2014and a guide to \u00e9thics and behavior.\n\nMany African peoples shared an underlying belief in a creator deity whose power\nand action were expressed through spirits or. lesser gods and through the founding an-\ncestors of the group. The ancestors often were viewed as the first settlers and thus the\n\u201cowners\u201d of the land or the local resources. Through them, the fertility of the land, game,\npeople, and herds could be ensured. Among some groups, working the land took on reli-\ngious significance, so the land itself had a meaning beyond its economic usefulness.\n\nReligion, economics, and history were thus closely intertwined.

Such a system was strongly linked to specific places and people.\nIt showed remarkable resiliency even in the face of contact with monotheistic religions\nsuch as Islam and Christianity.\n\nThe economies of Africa are harder to describe in general terms than some basic as-\npects of politics and culture.

Toward the end of the Roman Empire, Christianity\n\ntaken a firm hold in Mediterranean Africa, and with the rise of Islam and its sweep\n\noss the Maghrib or Western North Africa, and into Spain, the ties to the Mediterranean Maghrib\n\nworld became even closer. [MAH-gribb] The Arabic word for\nIslam offered many attractions within Africa. Its fundamental teaching that all Western North Africa.\n\nfuslims are equal within the community of believers made the acceptance of conquer-\n\n; and new rulers easier. The Islamic tradition of uniting the powers of the state and\n\neligion in the person of the ruler or caliph appealed to some African kings as a way\n\naf reinforcing their authority. The concept that all members of the umma, or commu-\n\nnity of believers, were equal put the newly converted Berbers and later Africans on an\n\nual footing with the Arabs, at least in law. Despite these egalitarian and somewhat\n\npian ideas within Islam, practices differed considerably at local levels. Social stratifi-\n\nion remained important\u2018in Islamicized societies, and ethnic distinctions also divided\n\nbelievers. Despite certain teachings on the equality between men and women, the\n\nfine for killing a man was twice that for killing a woman. The disparity between law and\n\nctice\u2014between equality before God and inequality within the world\u2014sometimes led\n\nto utopian reform movements.\n\n7.14 The Christian Kingdoms: Nubia and Ethiopia\n\nIslam was not the first universalistic religion to take root in Africa, and the wave of Arab\nconquests across Northern Africa had left behind it islands of Christianity.",

A sumptuous\ncourt was established and hosted a large number of traders. Mali grew wealthy from\nthe trade. Perhaps the most famous of Sundiata\u2019s successors was Mansa Kankan\nMusa (c. 1312-1337), whose pilgrimage to Mecca in 1324 brought the attention of\nthe Muslim world to Mali, as was described in the beginning of this chapter.

Estimates based on fragmentary sources,\nthe amount of available resources, and analysis of agricultural\nor hunting techniques have been used as rough guesses\nabout population size. The results often are inadequate\nor controversial, but historians believe that the question\nis important. Demography, the. study of population, has\nincreasingly become a valued tool of historical inquiry. Clearly,\nunless we know the size, density, age structure, health,\nand reproductive capacity of a population, it is difficult to\nunderstand many aspects of its society, politics, and economy.\nIn the contemporary world, most nations conduct periodic\ncensuses to assess the present situation of their populations\nand to plan for the future.

For\nmost of this history, the human population was very small\nand grew very slowly. Before agriculture was developed, the\nhunting-and-gathering economies of the world\u2019s populations\nsupported 5 million to 10 million people, if modern studies\nof such populations can be used as a guide. After about\n8000 B.c.c., when plants and animals were domesticated,\nthere was a first demographic transition as population\nbegan to increase more rapidly but still at a modest level.\nAgriculture provided a more secure and larger food supply,\nbut population concentration in villages and towns may have\nmade people more susceptible to disease and thus reduced\ntheir numbers. Other historians believe that the settled\nagricultural life also led to intensified warfare (because\nof the struggle for land and water) and increasing social\nstratification within societies.\n\nStill, the Neolithic Revolution and the development of\nagriculture stimulated population growth. It was the first\nmajor transition in the history of world population.

Some of the burial sites include well-produced _\npottery and other goods, and some burials seem to have been accompanied by ritual \u2014\nexecutions or sacrifices. All this indicates social stratification in the society. Cahokia, near \u2014\nEast St. Louis, Illinois, covered 5 square miles and may have had more than 30,000 people\nin and around its center. Its largest earthen pyramid, now called Monk\u2019s Mound, covers\n15 acres and is comparable in size to the largest pyramids of the classic period in Mexico.\nMany of these cultural features seem to suggest contact with Mesoamerica.\n\n8.1.1 The Aztec Rise to Power\n\nThe Toltec Empire lasted until about 1150, when it apparently was destroyed by nomadic\ninvaders from the north, who also seem to have sacked Tula about that time. The center\n-of population and political power in Central Mexico shifted to the valley of Mexico and.\nespecially to the shores of the large chain of lakes in that basin. These provided a rich\naquatic environment. The shores of the lakes were dotted with settlements and towns\nand supported a dense population. Of the approximately 3,000 square miles in the basin\nof the valley, about 400 square miles were under water. The lakes became the cultural \u2014\nheartland and population center of Mexico in the postclassical period. In the unstable\nworld of post-Toltec Mesoamerica, various peoples and cities jockeyed for control of\nthe lakes.

The cult of human sacri.\nfice and conquest was united with the political power of the ruler and the nobility. ;\n\n8.2 Aztec Religious and Economic\nStructure\n\nWhat were the main characteristics of Aztec society?\n\nThe Aztecs utilized many of the cultural and economic features they inherited from ear-: ;\nlier societies in the region.

Each god had at least five |\naspects, each associated with one of the cardinal directions and the center. Certain gods \u2014\nwere thought to be the patrons of specific cities, ethnic groups, or occupations.\n\nThe gods were supported by a round of yearly festivals and ceremonies that in-\nvolved feasting and dancing along with penance and sacrifice. This complex array of ~\ndeities can be organized into three major themes or cults. The first were the gods of fer-\ntility and the agricultural cycle, such as Tlaloc, the god of rain (called Chac by the Maya)\nand the gods and goddesses of water, maize, and fertility. A second group centered on ~\nthe creator deities, the great gods and goddesses who had brought the universe into be-\ning. The story of their actions played a central role in Aztec cosmography. Much Aztec\nabstract and philosophical thought was devoted to the theme of creation. Finally, the cult\u201d\nof warfare and sacrifice built on the preexisting Mesoamerican traditions that had been.\nexpanding since Toltec times and, under the militaristic Aztec state, became the cult of :\nthe state. Huitzilopochtli, the Aztec tribal patron, became the central figure of this cult.\n\nThe Aztecs revered the great traditional deities\u2014such as Tlaloc and Quetzalcoatl, an at\ncient god of civilization\u2014that were so holy to the Toltecs; but their own tribal deity, Huitzilo\npochtli, was paramount.

Warrior cults and the\n\nmilitaristic images of jaguars and eagles devouring human hearts were characteristic\nof Toltec art. The Aztecs simply took an existing tendency and carried it further. Both\nthe types and frequency of sacrifice increased, and a whole symbolism and ritual, which\nincluded cannibalism, developed as part of the cult (Figure 8.3). How much of Aztec\nsacrifice was the result of religious conviction and how much was a tactic of terror and\npolitical control by the rulers and priests is still open to debate.\n\nBeneath the surface of this polytheism, there was also a sense of spiritual unity.\nNezhualcoyotl, the king of Texcoco, wrote hymns to the \u201clord of the close vicinity,\u201d an\ninvisible creative force that supported all the gods.

They formed artificial floating islands about 17 feet long and 100 to 330 feets\nwide. This narrow construction allowed the water to reach all the plants, and willow\ntrees were also planted at intervals to give shade and help fix the roots. Much of the land\nof Tenochtitlan itself was chinampa in origin, and in the southern end of the lake, more ;\nthan 20,000 acres of chinampas were constructed.

Despite the importance\nof the markets, this was not a market economy as we usually understand it.\n\nThe state controlled the use and distribution of many commodities and redistributed\nthe vast amounts of tribute received from subordinate peoples. Tribute levels were as-\nsigned according to whether the subject peoples had accepted Aztec rule or had fought\nagainst it. Those who surrendered paid less. Tribute payments, such as food, slaves, and\nsacrificial victims, served political and economic ends. More than 120,000 mantles of cot-\nton cloth alone were collected as tribute each year and sent to Tenochtitlan. The Aztec\nstate redistributed these goods. After the original conquests, it rewarded its nobility\nrichly, and the commoners received far less.\n\n8.3 Aztec Society in Transition\n\nWhat were the principal strengths and constraints of the Aztec economy and social\nstructure?\n\nAs with all civilizations, Aztec society experienced changes over time.

Much of Aztec local life was based on\nthe calpulli, which performed important functions such as distributing land to heads of\nhouseholds, organizing labor gangs and military units in times of war, and maintaining a\ntemple and school.

Calloway, One Vast Win-\nter Count (2003), provides an excellent and up-to-date\noverview, while Linda Cordell, Ancient Pueblo Peoples\n(1994), and George Miner, The Moundbuilders: Ancient\nPeoples of Eastern North America (2004), provide more detail.\nCarroll L. Riley, Becoming Aztlan: Mesoamerican Influence\nin the Greater Southwest, AD 1200-1500 (2005) weighs the\nevidence on the possible ties between Mesoamerica and the\nAnasazi and other groups. Timothy R. Pauketat, Cahokia:\nAncient America\u2019s Great City on the Mississippi (2009), is a\ngood starting point on Mississippian cultures that suggests\ninspiration from Mesoamerica. Finally, on the question of\nthe populations of the Americas, see Noble D. Cook, Born\nto Die (1998), which tries to establish the populations when\npost-1492 contact took place, and Massimo Livi-Bacci,\nConquest: The Destruction of American Indios (2008) dismisses\nmonocausal explanations of Indian population decline\nand discusses the size of indigenous populations before\nconquest.\n\ning Questions\n\nj.

They undoubtedly originated from the discovery of; ji\nnaturally magnetized iron, or lodestone, that could then be used to fashion a needle that\n\nwould point north. Some believe that the Chinese first used compasses in the practice of\n\narr\nof\n\nthe forces of nature.\n\nfeng shui, a set of design principles by which people can align their living quarters with j\n\nCompasses for navigation had been introduced by 1100. They were part of a growing\nChinese effort to make contact with sources of spices and teas in Southeast Asia. Prior to:\nthat point, Chinese seagoing had been confined to coastlines, but now it became much? =\nmore venturesome (Figure 9.1). Wide-ranging Chinese expeditions introduced the com 7.\npass to seafarers throughout the Indian Ocean, including Arab merchants, by the twelfth, A :\ncentury. Europeans are first known to have used the compass in 1187. Europeans may.\nhave invented the compass separately, but it is far more likely that they learned about its\nuse as a result of contacts with Arabs or Asians.\n\nThe compass was fundamental to ambitious seagoing expeditions, like the great\n\nstars, the compass would provide the guidance for Columbus\u2019s travels to the Americas.\nEven before this it began to change the shape of world history by facilitating dramatic\nnew contacts and exchanges.

While there are a number of\nelements involved, the decline of the Mongols was a key spur. Because the rise and con-\nsolidation of the Mongol Empire had produced such profound effects in Asia and Europe,\nits gradual retreat inevitably had huge consequences. i\n\nThis chapter highlights the main changes taking shape by the early fifteenth century:\nThe principal focus is the shifting balance among civilizations in Asia, Africa, and Europe\nand how these power shifts changed the nature of international contact.\n\nThis period of transition began with the decline of Arab strength\u2014symbolized by\nthe fall of the last Arab caliphate in 1258\u2014and the disruptions that Mongol incursions\ncaused elsewhere in Asia and Eastern Europe. These developments created new op\nportunities in the Afro-Eurasian network that had been established during the previ-\nous centuries, initially under Arab sponsorship. Various candidates emerged to take\na new international leadership role once the Mongol Empire faded, including, for @\nshort time, Ming China.

Within the Middle East itself, Arab and then Mongol decline created new\n4 portunities for Turkish conquerors and migrants. In 1453 the Ottoman Turks cap-\ntured Constantinople, effectively completing the destruction of the Byzantine Empire\nand creating a new Islamic political power. The Ottomans quickly established control\naround much of the Black Sea, including the Balkans, and began to push southward\njnto Arab lands.\n\nWhile the Ottomans would play some role in transregional trade, the most dy-\nnamic new contender for leadership ultimately proved to be Western Europe; the con-\nditions that propelled Western civilization into this new position around 1400 form\nthe second key theme of this chapter. The West was not yet a major power; it did not\nreplace the Arabs or Chinese as international leaders quickly or easily. The first stages\nof the rise of the West were accompanied by important changes in Western civiliza-\ntion itself, which were beginning to take shape by 1400. At this point, Italy, Spain, and\nPortugal took the lead in Western European outreach, a lead that they would hold for\nabout two centuries.\n\nIt is also vital to note changes in societies outside the international network, in\nthe Americas and Polynesia. New difficulties in the great American empires, in partic-\nular, would reduce their ability to respond to the challenge of contact with Europeans\nafter 1492.\n\nFocusing on new frameworks for international contacts, this chapter inevitably deals\nwith the question of why individual societies reacted differently to key forces. Compar-\nison is essential. Western Europe\u2019s response, for example, should be compared to reac-\ntions at the same time in regions like Japan or sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nAmid variations and great change, the transitions around 1450 highlighted one im-\nportant continuity as well: the importance of the level of contacts that had developed\nthrough the formation of the transcontinental network.

Developments occurred in various aspects of }\nsociety, and some of them are not easy to explain. y\nCulture shifted, along with politics, in this crucial region. An earlier tension in phi-\nlosophy and the arts yielded to the predominance of the Islamic faith. The new Piety \u2014\nassociated with the rising Sufi movement, discussed in Chapter 5, contributed to a ney\nreligious emphasis. In literature, attention to secular themes, such as the joys of feasting\u201d\nand hunting, gave way to more strictly religious ideas. The same shift occurred in phi\nlosophy, with new attacks on the idea of combining faith with reason. Thus Al-Ghazali\nin a book revealingly titled The Destruction of the Philosophers, claimed. to use Aristotle's\u2019\nlogic to show that it was imposible to discover religious truth by human reason. Many =\nSufi scholars wrote excitedly of their mystical contacts with God and the stages of their\nreligious passion. Islamic science continued, but its role diminished. q\nChanges in society and the economy were as telling as the shifts in politics and in:\ntellectual life. As the authority of the caliphate declined, landlords seized power over th\npeasantry. As a result, from about 1100 onward, Middle Eastern peasants increasingly lost _\ntheir freedom, becoming serfs on large estates, providing the labor and produce landlords \u2014\nsought. This loss was not the peasants\u2019 alone, for agricultural productivity suffered as a re-\nsult. Landlords turned to sucking what they could from their estates rather than trying to\ndevelop a more vital agriculture. Tax revenues declined, and Arab and other Middle Eastern\ntraders began to lose ground. Few Arab coins have been found in Europe dating from later i\nthan 1100. European merchants began to control their own turf and challenge the Arabs in\n:\n|\n|\n\nother parts of the Mediterranean, gaining increasing initiative in this vital trading area.\n\nArab decline was gradual and incomplete.

The reduced dynamism in trade did not\ntake the Arabs out of major world markets, for example. Indeed, Middle Eastern com-\nmerce rebounded somewhat by 1400.\n\nFinally, the political fragmentation of the Arab world did not produce prolonged\nconfusion in the Middle East or in the religion of Islam. The emerging Ottoman Turk\nish state soon mastered many of the lands of the old caliphate as well as the Byzantine\ncorner, expanding into Southeastern Europe. The new empire gave renewed vitality to\nIslamic politics, and it would soon be joined by two other Islamic empires, in Persia and\nIndia. (See Chapter 15 for the development of the Ottoman Empire.) It is important to\nrealize that the empire was far more powerful, politically and militarily, than the caliph-\nate had been for many centuries. It was thus more challenging to rivals in neighboring\ncivilizations such as Western Europe or Russia.\n\n9.2 The Structure of Transregional Trade\n\nWhat caused the Chinese decision to abandon major expeditions?\n\nEven the rise of the Ottoman Empire would not restore the full international vigor that\nthe Islamic caliphate had wielded had at the height of its powers. The empire did not be\ncome the sole hub of an international network, as the caliphate had been a few centuries\nbefore. By the fifteenth century, merchants from many societies were competing for roles\nin transregional trade. In the Mediterranean, Europe, and particularly Italy, merchants\nwere increasingly active. In the Indian Ocean, merchants from India and Southeast Asia,\nmost of them Muslims, rivaled Arab activity.\n\nThe big issue in the fifteenth century, however, involved the aftermath of the Mongol\nera.

Essentially, this Mongol system had replaced earlier\nArab leadership in facilitating transregional trade. But the Mongol defeat in China, late\nin the fourteenth century, and new pressure on Mongol rulers in Russia and elsewhere\nunraveled this system. Overland travel became more difficult and dangerous without\nMongol political protection. Trade and its motivations did not diminish in importance,\nput inevitably new emphasis focused on seagoing routes, particularly in the Indian\nOcean. Two societies, first China and then Europe, sought to take advantage of the op-\n\nportunities involved.\n\n9.2.1 Chinese Outreach and Reconsideration\n\nFor a brief time China asserted new leadership in international trade. This activity\nreflected earlier gains in Chinese shipping, and China\u2019s long-standing focus on manufac-\nturing for export. Rebellions in China drove out the deeply resented Mongol overlords\nin 1368. A rebel leader from a peasant family, Zhu Yuanzhang (joo wan-jang), seized the\nMongol capital of Beijing and proclaimed a new Ming\u2014meaning \u201cbrilliant\u2019\u201d\u2014dynasty\nthat was to last until 1644. The dynasty began with a burst of unusual expansionism.\nThe initial Ming rulers pressed to secure the borders of the Middle Kingdom. This meant\npushing the Mongols far to the north, to the plains of what is now Mongolia. It meant rees-\ntablishing influence over neighboring governments and winning tribute payments from\nstates in Korea, Vietnam, and Tibet, reviving much of the East Asian regional structure set\nup by the Tang dynasty. Far more unusual was a new policy, adopted soon after 1400, of\nmounting huge, state-sponsored trading expeditions to Southern Asia and beyond.",

Far more unusual was a new policy, adopted soon after 1400, of\nmounting huge, state-sponsored trading expeditions to Southern Asia and beyond.\n\nA first fleet sailed in 1405 to India, with 62 ships carrying 28,000 men. Later voyages\nreached the Middle East and the eastern coast of Africa, bringing chinaware and copper\ncoinage in exchange for local goods. Chinese shipping at its height consisted of 2,700\ncoastal vessels, 400 armed naval ships, and at least as many long-distance ships. Nine\ngreat treasure ships, the most sophisticated in the world at the time, explored the Indian\nOcean, the Persian Gulf, and the Red Sea, establishing trade connections but also seeking\ntribute payments all along the way.\n\nBetween 1405 and their termination in 1433, these expeditions were commanded by the\nadmiral Zheng He. A Muslim from Western China, Zheng He was well suited to deal with\nMuslims in Southeast Asia on the Indian Ocean trade route. Zheng He was also a eunuch,\ncastrated for service at the royal court. China\u2019s Ming emperors retained a large harem of\nwives to ensure succession, and eunuchs were needed to guard them without threat of sex-\nual rivalry; many gained bureaucratic powers well beyond this service. Zheng He\u2019s expe-\nditions usually hugged the coastline, but he had an improved compass and excellent maps\nas well as huge vessels that contained ample supplies\u2014even gardens\u2014as well as goods\nfor trade.

What are\nthe principal interpretations?\n\n|\n)\nThe West\u2019s gradual emergence into larger world contacts during the fifteenth century t\nwas surprising in many respects. Western expansion had numerous causes, and it must i\nbe seen as a result of growing problems as well as new strengths. }\n\nWesterners remained awed by the powerful bureaucracies and opulent treasuries of\nempires in the traditional civilization centers such as Constantinople. Furthermore, the\nWest was changing in some painful ways. Key features of medieval culture and society\nwere being questioned by 1400. The church, which had long been one of the organiz-\ning institutions of Western civilization, was under new attack. Medieval philosophy had )\npassed its creative phase. Warrior aristocrats, long a key leadership group in feudal so- t\nciety, softened their style of life, preferring court rituals and jousting tournaments and\nadopting military armor so cumbersome that real fighting was difficult.\n\nEven more strikingly, the lives and economic activities of ordinary Europeans were in\ndisarray.

In exchange for the hn _\nury items, Europeans mainly had cruder goods to offer: wool, tin, copper, honey, and salt,\nThe value of European exports almost never equaled the value of what was imported from\nAsia.

Nothing like the great numbers who died\nin the years.1348 and 1349 has been heard of or seen\nor read of in times past. This plague and disease came\nfrom ymaginatione or association and contagion, for if a\nwell man visited the sick he only rarely avoided the risk\nof death. Wherefore in many towns timid priests with-\ndrew, leaving the exercise of their ministry to such of the\nreligious as were more daring.... A very great number\nof the saintly sisters of the H\u00e9tel-Dieu who, not fearing\nto die, nursed the sick in all sweetness and humility,\nwith no thought of honor, a number too often renewed\nby death, rest in peace with Christ, as we may piously\nbelieve.\n\nSome sai\u00a2 that this pestilence was caused by infec-\ntion of the air and waters, since there was at this time no\nfamine nor lack of food supplies, but on the contrary great\nabundance. As a result of this theory of infected water\nand air as the source of the Plague the Jews were sud-\ndenly and violently charged with infecting wells and water\nand corrupting the air.

The subject matter of art\nmoved toward nature and people, including cityscapes and portraits of the rich and pow-\nerful, whether the themes were religious or secular. Florentine painter Giotto (gee-YAW-\ntoh) led the way, departing from medieval formalism and stiffness. While still a young\napprentice to the painter Cimabue (chee-mah-BOO-eh), Giotto painted a fly on the nose\nof one of Cimabue\u2019s portrait subjects, and it was so realistic that Cimabue repeatedly\ntried to swat it off before going back to work on the canvas. Other painters, beginning\nlater in the fourteenth century, started to introduce perspective while using new colors\nand other materials. In architecture, favor shifted away from the Gothic to a classicism\nderived from the styles of Greece and Rome. Vivid, realistic statues complemented the\new palaces and public buildings. 4\n\nThe impact of the early Renaissance must not be exaggerated. It had little influence\nOutside of Italy.

Soon after 1400, major regional monarchies had, i\nbeen established in the provinces of Castile and Aragon, which would be united throug\nroyal marriage in 1469. .\n\nEven before the marriage between Ferdinand and Isabella, Spanish and Por-\ntuguese rulers had developed a vigorous military and religious agenda. They sup- \u2014\nported effective armies, including infantry and noble cavalry. And they believed\nthat government had a mission to promote Christianity by converting or expelling \u2014 4\nArabs and Jews and by maintaining doctrinal purity within the church. Close links ;\nbetween church and state, portrayed in art, provided revenues and officials for the \u2014\nroyal government. In return, the government supported church courts in their efforts\nto enforce moral and doctrinal purity. Later in the fifteenth century, this interaction \u2014\nled to the reestablishment of the church-run courts of the Inquisition in Spain, de-\nsigned to enforce religious orthodoxy.

These islands had been known vaguely since clas-\nsical times but had never been explored by Europeans. Genoese sailors also visited the\nMadeiras and probably reached the more distant Azores by 1351. Soon after this, ships\nfrom Northeastern Spain, based in the port of Barcelona, sailed along the African coast a8\nfar south as present-day Sierra Leone.\n\nUntil 1430, technological barriers prevented further exploration for alternative\nroutes. Without adequate navigation instruments, Europeans could not risk wider\nventures into the Atlantic. They also needed better ships than the shallow-drafted,\noar-propelled Mediterranean galleys. However, efforts were underway to develop au\noceangoing sailing vessel.

Many merchants in that period contributed generously to the churches in cities and some renounced their commercial pasts on their deathbeds.\n3. Europe in 1200 was divided between eastern Orthodox Christianity and western Catholicism, with a fuzzy boundary line between the two regions.\n4. Trade routes during this period were oriented towards north-south patterns, with a focus on reaching Constantinople and the Mediterranean.\n5. The Mongol period further increased east-west divisions, as the Mongols directly took over much of Eastern Europe, while Western Europe benefited from the contacts facilitated by the Mongol network.\n6. Several significant events took place during this period, such as the Fourth Crusade and the sack of Constantinople, the Hundred Years' War, the Black Death, the formation of a single Spanish monarchy, and the expulsion of Tatars from Russia.\n- In 1204, a crusader force attacked and looted the Byzantine city of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade.\n- This attack worsened relationships between eastern and western Christians and contributed to the decline of the Byzantine Empire.",

He is the sincere\\none. One\\u2019s father is diligent, solicitous, compassionate,\\nsympathetic, a careful administrator of his household. He\\nrears, he teaches others, he advises, he admonishes one. He\\nis exemplary; he leads a model life. He stores up for himself;\\nhe stores up for others. He cares for his assets; he saves for\\nothers. He is thrifty; he saves for the future, teaches thrift. He\\nregulates, distributes with care, establishes order.\\n\\n\\u201cThe bad father is incompassionate, negligent, unreliable.\\nHe is unfeeling... a shirker, a loafer, a sullen worker.\\n\\nMother\\n\\nOne\\u2019s mother has children; she suckles them.
