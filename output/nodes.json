His biographer, a clergyman named Reginald\nof Durham, is eager to emphasize Godric\u2019s consistent Christianity. He portrays Godric as con-\ntent, with a simple life even amid his riches, and quickly attracted to the saints and a life of God.\nHe argues that Godric\u2019s sea voyages, which were undoubtedly risky, helped the future saint\nrealize the importance of divine aid\u2014and surely religion did often provide a sense of security\nto venturesome merchants. Finally, however, a purely material life did not seem sufficient.\n\nGodric began visiting saints\u2019 shrines with increasing frequency. He began to be dis-\nturbed by the high living\u2014feasting and drinking\u2014of some of his merchant colleagues.\nHe also found that some of them stole outright. He attempted to correct them but was re-\nbuffed. Ashamed of his own materialism (and possibly of some misdeeds of his own), he\nwent on a pilgrimage to Rome. After that, with his parents\u2019 blessing, he decided to give\nhimself entirely to a religious life. He sold all of his goods, gave the proceeds to the poor,\nand spent the rest of his life wandering as a religious hermit.\n\nFew Europeans lived lives as polarized as that of Godric, but many, particularly in\ngrowing cities, felt some tension between commercial change and religious commitment\n(Figure 6.1).

For Western Europe, long recovering from the fall of the\nwestern Roman Empire, these centuries saw important innovations in a number of do-\nmains, from family to new kinds of intellectual initiatives. Political structures remained\nrelatively weak and decentralized, but here too there were signs of change.\n\nIn 1204 a crusader force from the west, in theory on the way to bolster the Chris-\ntian territory around Jerusalem, changed course and attacked and looted the great\nByzantine city of Constantinople\u2014though it was a Christian center. This followed a\nByzantine attack on Catholic Christians living in the city, and it both reflected and\ncontributed to the growing weakness of the Byzantine state. The episode\u2014technically\ncalled the Fourth Crusade\u2014severely worsened relationships between eastern and\nwestern Christians. Some argue that relations have been improved only recently, for\nthe attack featured great brutality. While the Byzantine Empire was restored a few\ndecades later, it never really recovered. For Western Europe the episode marked a re-\nduction of the kind of religious fervor that had inspired the early crusades, in favor of\ngrowing interests in commercial advance and political rivalry. Europe was changing in\n\nmany ways.\n\n6.1 Eastern Europe\n\nHow and why was the Byzantine Empire in decline?\n\nThe decline of the great Byzantine Empire had begum well before the violence of the\nFourth Crusade, after centuries in which the empire had fostered careful military and\npolitical organization while serving as the center for Orthodox Christianity and a major\ntrade hub as well (Figure 6.2). Some important cultural activities continued, in both art\nand philosophy, but the Byzantine economy and political apparatus clearly deteriorated.\nAs the empire weakened, Turkish migrants gained ground in many parts of the North-\nern Middle East, forming a kingdom east of Constantinople in the fourteenth century.\nThese Turkish peoples, ultimately called Ottomans, had converted to Islam in their Cen-\ntral Asian homeland, and they brought considerable religious fervor as well as a taste for\npolitical expansion into this new domain.\n\nSeveral small Christian states also emerged in the Balkans, in Southeastern Eu-\nTope, as Byzantium declined, headed by the kingdom of Serbia.",

Mongol conquests not only did not reach Western\nEurope directly, but many Europeans were able to take advantage of Mongol rule to es-\ntablish new and fruitful contacts with Asia. These contacts were one important element\nin a set of new gains for the region.\n\n\n--- End of Page 5 ---\n152 Part Il: The Mongol Age, 1200-1450\n\nBlack Death\n\nPlague that struck Europe in\nfourteenth century; significantly\nreduced Europe\u2019s population;\naffected social structure.\n\nAfter the fall of the great Roman Empire, Western Europe entered a period usually\ncalled the Middle Ages\u2014centuries characterized, among other things, by the spread\nand impact of Catholic Christianity. Medieval Europe was long subject to invasion and\nsuffered from frequent disorder and limited urban life. Well before 1200, however, the\nregion began to experience a number of innovations, some of which persisted into the\nfifteenth century.\n\nAmid significant changes, Western Europe continued to lag behind Asia in a number\nof important respects. Political units remained largely decentralized. Trade and produc-\ntion advanced, but the region continued to depend on a somewhat inferior technology\noverall; a key reason that new contacts with Asia were so important as was the access\nthey provided to inventions such as printing. Cities had gained some population, but\nthey were smaller than the major ceriters in Asia,.and the region continued to depend\nprimarily on locally focused agriculture. Western Europe was also deeply affected-by\nthe new series of plagues in the fourteenth century\u2014the fearsome Black Death (bubonic\nplague) that originated in China and spread to the Middle East and then the European\ncontinent, carrying off a third or more of the population.

But\nbasic trends were decidedly mixed, with significant innovations balanced against new\nchallenges. As one result, the region became measurably less tolerant. The centuries after\n1200 saw a number of new attacks on the Jewish minority (and in Spain, on the Muslim\nminority as well), new laws directed against homosexuality, and new military attacks on\ndissident Christian groups.\n\n6.3.1 Political Patterns\n\nBy 1200, important monarchies had developed in France and Britain, and Spain would\nsoon join their ranks. Kings had developed complex relationships with leading noble\nfamilies, many of whom kept their own armies. Small bureaucracies served the kings\ndirectly, along with a modest professional military force, though the kingdoms remained\nvery decentralized and often depended on the nobles for support. In France, for example,\nKing Philip I] Augustus (1180-1223) used several methods to improve his position as\ntuler. He expanded the territory under his control in a series of military campaigns. He\npaid middle-class officials in his administration, regarding them as more loyal and more\ntalented than regional nobles. He was able to send some central officials into outlying\nareas, to bolster royal control. And he used growing tax revenues to hire mercenary sol-\ndiers under his direct authority. Here, clearly, was the nucleus of a more effective central\ngovernment. But it had serious limits, as regional nobles had considerable independence,\nand even the king had to be sure to select aristocrats as military generals. Monarchy re-\nmained a balancing act in Western Europe.\n\nStronger governments brought some other changes. Headed by France, several of\nthe monarchies sought to rein in the power of the pope, who was often regarded more as\na political rival than as a religious leader. As Christian victories against Muslims in Spain\nmounted\u2014a Christian victory in 1212 reduced Spanish Islam to scattered local holdings,\nparticularly around the city of Granada\u2014new governments were established on the pen-\ninsula.",

In 1215 powerful nobles in Britain,\nresenting the efforts of an unpopular king to try to raise revenues, forced the ruler to\n\n--- End of Page 6 ---\nChapter 6: Europe in the Mongol Era 153\n\nsign the Magna Carta.

In France, for example, 80 new cathedrals\n\nFigure 6.3\n\nwere built between 1180 and 1270 (Figure 6.3).\n\nCreativity showed also in the continuing\neffort to integrate classical philosophy and Chris-\ntian theology; debates over the respective roles of\nfaith and reason mirrored earlier discussions in the\nIslamic Middle East, partly through the translation\nof some of the key Middle Eastern texts. The theo-\nlogian Thomas Aquinas, an Italian monk working\nin Paris, sought to sum up all relevant knowledge\nin a massive series of books\u2014called Summas, or\ncompendia, of all important knowledge. Aquinas:\nmade it clear that faith always must come first, but\nhe greatly expanded the scope for human reason\n~ including the human capacity to understand the\nnatural order. Aquinas also sought to show how\nreason could supplement faith in providing clear\nethical guidelines, not only for personal behavior\nbut in economic life as well.\n\nAn expanded scope for rational philosophy\nalso helped promote some new work in science,\nagain from the thirteenth century onward.

Geoffrey Chaucer (d. 1400)\nwould become known as the effective father of English literature, writing a series of\nlively stories about popular behavior and mixing Christian piety with a delight in\nearthy themes. Chaucer\u2019s famous Canterbury Tales poked fun at the hypocrisy of many\nChristians while also capturing some of the small tragedies of human existence. The\nFrench poet Francois Villon, writing around 1450, wrote about some of his criminal\nencounters with the police and other worldly topics in a lyrical French style. He also\nconveyed, in largely secular terms, some of the terror and poignancy of death. Clearly,\nthe thematic range and the linguistic variety of European literature were expanding in\nimportant ways.\n\nVarious European authors also began to develop poems and stories emphasizing\ncourtly love\u2014the great passion that could draw men and women together, though\nappropriately restrained by manners and morality. For example, Christine de Pisan\u2014an\nItalian woman working in France\u2014wrote a series of ballads dedicated to leading female\naristocrats and members of the royal family, including love themes but also fanciful\nrenderings of older Greek stories recast to praise the French monarchy.\n\nWork in the visual arts\u2014including, of course, the great churches\u2014continued to em-\nphasize religious scenes in Northern Europe. Some historians have argued that, by the\nfourteenth and fifteenth centuries, some of this religious art was becoming less creative,\nmore crowded and mechanical, possibly sharing some of the same kinds of cultural\nfatigue that was showing up in philosophy.\n\nIn the Italian city-states, however, a newer kind of artistic movement was taking\nshape, reflecting a revival of interest in classical styles and themes and a reduction\u2014\nthough not an elimination\u2014of religious focus.

Thus Italian architects began\nto revive classical styles for both churches and public buildings, instead of the Gothic\nstyle that remained dominant to the north.

It is vital to note that great poverty remained\u2014this was not, overall, a wealthy\n\u2018 society. But some shifts may have begun that would affect economic decisions later on. *\nFinally, and more certainly, family patterns began to change in distinctive ways.\nProbably in order to protect property holdings against the burden of too many children,\nmost ordinary Western Europeans began to marry later\u2014in their late twenties. The re-\nsult increased the importance of the nuclear family\u2014parents and their children\u2014for the\n! simple reason that, when children were born to parents near or past 30 years of age,\n, their grandparents were likely to be quite old or even already deceased. Large, extended\nfamilies\u2014common in many other societies\u2014could not be sustained in these conditions.\nThis new \u201cEuropean-style family\u201d was certainly distinctive. It depended on fairly strict\ncontrols over the sexual behavior of young adults, asked now to delay marriage until\nwell after puberty. It might promote more cooperation between husbands and wives in\nthe family itself, since they had few adult relatives to depend on.

But the rise of the Mongols\ndid have decisive importance for Western Europe\u2019s contacts\nwith the wider world, particularly in expanding opportunities\nfor interaction with Asia. Travel to and from China, along with\nsteady growth in exchanges with the Middle East, stoked\nappetites for wider trade and also increased European exposure\nto more advanced technologies and political systems.\n\nBy 1200, thanks in part to the earlier crusades to the\nHoly Land, some Europeans became increasingly aware of\nthe products available through greater trade with the Middle\nEast. Spices\u2014including sugar, a highly valued sweetener for\nupper-class. occasions, and an expensive one at that\u2014gained\nnew attention, along with some manufactured products such\nas metal wares. These contacts had also provided Europeans\nwith knowledge of new technologies such as the compass and\nimproved sailing ships (Map 6.3). Europeans had also imported\nelements of Arab science and mathematics, plus artistic styles\nand even the idea of a special commercial law.
