He\nparticipated in seagoing trade with other ports of Britain and with the European conti-\nnent, and he clearly made a good living, acquiring a number of ships.\n\nBut he was not entirely at peace with himself. His biographer, a clergyman named Reginald\nof Durham, is eager to emphasize Godric\u2019s consistent Christianity. He portrays Godric as con-\ntent, with a simple life even amid his riches, and quickly attracted to the saints and a life of God.\nHe argues that Godric\u2019s sea voyages, which were undoubtedly risky, helped the future saint\nrealize the importance of divine aid\u2014and surely religion did often provide a sense of security\nto venturesome merchants. Finally, however, a purely material life did not seem sufficient.\n\nGodric began visiting saints\u2019 shrines with increasing frequency. He began to be dis-\nturbed by the high living\u2014feasting and drinking\u2014of some of his merchant colleagues.\nHe also found that some of them stole outright. He attempted to correct them but was re-\nbuffed. Ashamed of his own materialism (and possibly of some misdeeds of his own), he\nwent on a pilgrimage to Rome. After that, with his parents\u2019 blessing, he decided to give\nhimself entirely to a religious life. He sold all of his goods, gave the proceeds to the poor,\nand spent the rest of his life wandering as a religious hermit.\n\nFew Europeans lived lives as polarized as that of Godric, but many, particularly in\ngrowing cities, felt some tension between commercial change and religious commitment\n(Figure 6.1).

For Western Europe, long recovering from the fall of the\nwestern Roman Empire, these centuries saw important innovations in a number of do-\nmains, from family to new kinds of intellectual initiatives. Political structures remained\nrelatively weak and decentralized, but here too there were signs of change.\n\nIn 1204 a crusader force from the west, in theory on the way to bolster the Chris-\ntian territory around Jerusalem, changed course and attacked and looted the great\nByzantine city of Constantinople\u2014though it was a Christian center. This followed a\nByzantine attack on Catholic Christians living in the city, and it both reflected and\ncontributed to the growing weakness of the Byzantine state. The episode\u2014technically\ncalled the Fourth Crusade\u2014severely worsened relationships between eastern and\nwestern Christians. Some argue that relations have been improved only recently, for\nthe attack featured great brutality. While the Byzantine Empire was restored a few\ndecades later, it never really recovered. For Western Europe the episode marked a re-\nduction of the kind of religious fervor that had inspired the early crusades, in favor of\ngrowing interests in commercial advance and political rivalry. Europe was changing in\n\nmany ways.\n\n6.1 Eastern Europe\n\nHow and why was the Byzantine Empire in decline?\n\nThe decline of the great Byzantine Empire had begum well before the violence of the\nFourth Crusade, after centuries in which the empire had fostered careful military and\npolitical organization while serving as the center for Orthodox Christianity and a major\ntrade hub as well (Figure 6.2). Some important cultural activities continued, in both art\nand philosophy, but the Byzantine economy and political apparatus clearly deteriorated.\nAs the empire weakened, Turkish migrants gained ground in many parts of the North-\nern Middle East, forming a kingdom east of Constantinople in the fourteenth century.\nThese Turkish peoples, ultimately called Ottomans, had converted to Islam in their Cen-\ntral Asian homeland, and they brought considerable religious fervor as well as a taste for\npolitical expansion into this new domain.\n\nSeveral small Christian states also emerged in the Balkans, in Southeastern Eu-\nTope, as Byzantium declined, headed by the kingdom of Serbia.",

Mongol conquests not only did not reach Western\nEurope directly, but many Europeans were able to take advantage of Mongol rule to es-\ntablish new and fruitful contacts with Asia. These contacts were one important element\nin a set of new gains for the region.\n\n\n--- End of Page 5 ---\n152 Part Il: The Mongol Age, 1200-1450\n\nBlack Death\n\nPlague that struck Europe in\nfourteenth century; significantly\nreduced Europe\u2019s population;\naffected social structure.\n\nAfter the fall of the great Roman Empire, Western Europe entered a period usually\ncalled the Middle Ages\u2014centuries characterized, among other things, by the spread\nand impact of Catholic Christianity. Medieval Europe was long subject to invasion and\nsuffered from frequent disorder and limited urban life. Well before 1200, however, the\nregion began to experience a number of innovations, some of which persisted into the\nfifteenth century.\n\nAmid significant changes, Western Europe continued to lag behind Asia in a number\nof important respects. Political units remained largely decentralized. Trade and produc-\ntion advanced, but the region continued to depend on a somewhat inferior technology\noverall; a key reason that new contacts with Asia were so important as was the access\nthey provided to inventions such as printing. Cities had gained some population, but\nthey were smaller than the major ceriters in Asia,.and the region continued to depend\nprimarily on locally focused agriculture. Western Europe was also deeply affected-by\nthe new series of plagues in the fourteenth century\u2014the fearsome Black Death (bubonic\nplague) that originated in China and spread to the Middle East and then the European\ncontinent, carrying off a third or more of the population.

But\nbasic trends were decidedly mixed, with significant innovations balanced against new\nchallenges. As one result, the region became measurably less tolerant. The centuries after\n1200 saw a number of new attacks on the Jewish minority (and in Spain, on the Muslim\nminority as well), new laws directed against homosexuality, and new military attacks on\ndissident Christian groups.\n\n6.3.1 Political Patterns\n\nBy 1200, important monarchies had developed in France and Britain, and Spain would\nsoon join their ranks. Kings had developed complex relationships with leading noble\nfamilies, many of whom kept their own armies. Small bureaucracies served the kings\ndirectly, along with a modest professional military force, though the kingdoms remained\nvery decentralized and often depended on the nobles for support. In France, for example,\nKing Philip I] Augustus (1180-1223) used several methods to improve his position as\ntuler. He expanded the territory under his control in a series of military campaigns. He\npaid middle-class officials in his administration, regarding them as more loyal and more\ntalented than regional nobles. He was able to send some central officials into outlying\nareas, to bolster royal control. And he used growing tax revenues to hire mercenary sol-\ndiers under his direct authority. Here, clearly, was the nucleus of a more effective central\ngovernment. But it had serious limits, as regional nobles had considerable independence,\nand even the king had to be sure to select aristocrats as military generals. Monarchy re-\nmained a balancing act in Western Europe.\n\nStronger governments brought some other changes. Headed by France, several of\nthe monarchies sought to rein in the power of the pope, who was often regarded more as\na political rival than as a religious leader. As Christian victories against Muslims in Spain\nmounted\u2014a Christian victory in 1212 reduced Spanish Islam to scattered local holdings,\nparticularly around the city of Granada\u2014new governments were established on the pen-\ninsula.",

In 1215 powerful nobles in Britain,\nresenting the efforts of an unpopular king to try to raise revenues, forced the ruler to\n\n--- End of Page 6 ---\nChapter 6: Europe in the Mongol Era 153\n\nsign the Magna Carta.

In France, for example, 80 new cathedrals\n\nFigure 6.3\n\nwere built between 1180 and 1270 (Figure 6.3).\n\nCreativity showed also in the continuing\neffort to integrate classical philosophy and Chris-\ntian theology; debates over the respective roles of\nfaith and reason mirrored earlier discussions in the\nIslamic Middle East, partly through the translation\nof some of the key Middle Eastern texts. The theo-\nlogian Thomas Aquinas, an Italian monk working\nin Paris, sought to sum up all relevant knowledge\nin a massive series of books\u2014called Summas, or\ncompendia, of all important knowledge. Aquinas:\nmade it clear that faith always must come first, but\nhe greatly expanded the scope for human reason\n~ including the human capacity to understand the\nnatural order. Aquinas also sought to show how\nreason could supplement faith in providing clear\nethical guidelines, not only for personal behavior\nbut in economic life as well.\n\nAn expanded scope for rational philosophy\nalso helped promote some new work in science,\nagain from the thirteenth century onward.

Geoffrey Chaucer (d. 1400)\nwould become known as the effective father of English literature, writing a series of\nlively stories about popular behavior and mixing Christian piety with a delight in\nearthy themes. Chaucer\u2019s famous Canterbury Tales poked fun at the hypocrisy of many\nChristians while also capturing some of the small tragedies of human existence. The\nFrench poet Francois Villon, writing around 1450, wrote about some of his criminal\nencounters with the police and other worldly topics in a lyrical French style. He also\nconveyed, in largely secular terms, some of the terror and poignancy of death. Clearly,\nthe thematic range and the linguistic variety of European literature were expanding in\nimportant ways.\n\nVarious European authors also began to develop poems and stories emphasizing\ncourtly love\u2014the great passion that could draw men and women together, though\nappropriately restrained by manners and morality. For example, Christine de Pisan\u2014an\nItalian woman working in France\u2014wrote a series of ballads dedicated to leading female\naristocrats and members of the royal family, including love themes but also fanciful\nrenderings of older Greek stories recast to praise the French monarchy.\n\nWork in the visual arts\u2014including, of course, the great churches\u2014continued to em-\nphasize religious scenes in Northern Europe. Some historians have argued that, by the\nfourteenth and fifteenth centuries, some of this religious art was becoming less creative,\nmore crowded and mechanical, possibly sharing some of the same kinds of cultural\nfatigue that was showing up in philosophy.\n\nIn the Italian city-states, however, a newer kind of artistic movement was taking\nshape, reflecting a revival of interest in classical styles and themes and a reduction\u2014\nthough not an elimination\u2014of religious focus.

Thus Italian architects began\nto revive classical styles for both churches and public buildings, instead of the Gothic\nstyle that remained dominant to the north.

It is vital to note that great poverty remained\u2014this was not, overall, a wealthy\n\u2018 society. But some shifts may have begun that would affect economic decisions later on. *\nFinally, and more certainly, family patterns began to change in distinctive ways.\nProbably in order to protect property holdings against the burden of too many children,\nmost ordinary Western Europeans began to marry later\u2014in their late twenties. The re-\nsult increased the importance of the nuclear family\u2014parents and their children\u2014for the\n! simple reason that, when children were born to parents near or past 30 years of age,\n, their grandparents were likely to be quite old or even already deceased. Large, extended\nfamilies\u2014common in many other societies\u2014could not be sustained in these conditions.\nThis new \u201cEuropean-style family\u201d was certainly distinctive. It depended on fairly strict\ncontrols over the sexual behavior of young adults, asked now to delay marriage until\nwell after puberty. It might promote more cooperation between husbands and wives in\nthe family itself, since they had few adult relatives to depend on.

But the rise of the Mongols\ndid have decisive importance for Western Europe\u2019s contacts\nwith the wider world, particularly in expanding opportunities\nfor interaction with Asia. Travel to and from China, along with\nsteady growth in exchanges with the Middle East, stoked\nappetites for wider trade and also increased European exposure\nto more advanced technologies and political systems.\n\nBy 1200, thanks in part to the earlier crusades to the\nHoly Land, some Europeans became increasingly aware of\nthe products available through greater trade with the Middle\nEast. Spices\u2014including sugar, a highly valued sweetener for\nupper-class. occasions, and an expensive one at that\u2014gained\nnew attention, along with some manufactured products such\nas metal wares. These contacts had also provided Europeans\nwith knowledge of new technologies such as the compass and\nimproved sailing ships (Map 6.3).

A number of Europeans\nquickly took advantage of the opportunity to enter the Mongol\nrealm, usually from Persia, often obtaining letters assuring\nsafe conduct all the way to China.

This chapter will examine*\nthe increasing impact of a growing international network on Africa roughly in the period\nM between 1200 and 1600 c.z. The arrival of Islam, after 800 -\u00a2.2., had transformed many\naspects of life in some African societies and brought them into wider contacts through\nj trade, politics, and cultural exchange. But we must also recognize that the African societies\ninfluenced by Islam often maintained their own traditions and that other African regions\nremained little touched by Islam and continued to develop along their own trajectories.\nIt is also important to realize that interactions with North Africa and the Middle East did\nnot extend to direct encounters with the great Mongol Empire during this crucial period.\nAfrican civilizations built somewhat less clearly on prior societies than did other\ncivilizations around 1200. Some earlier themes, such as the Bantu migration and the\n, formation of large states in the Western Sudan, noted in Chapter 2, persisted. Overall,\nsub-Saharan Africa remained a varied and distinctive setting; parts of it, like the port\ncities of the East African coast, were drawn into new contacts with the growing world\nnetwork, but much of it retained a certain isolation or cultural autonomy.

The\nformation of some powerful states, such as Mali and Songhay, depended more on milj-\ntary power and dynastic alliances than on ethnic or cultural unity.

The spread of the Bantu-speaking peoples\nprovided a linguistic base across much of Africa, so that even though specific languages\ndiffered, structure and vocabulary allowed some mutual understanding between neigh-\nboring Bantu speakers. .\n\nThe same might be said of the animistic religion that characterized much of Africa.\nFrom the continent's earliest beginnings people held a belief that a soul or spirit existed\nin every object, even if it was inanimate. In a future state this soul or spirit would exist\nas part of an immaterial soul. The spirit, therefore, was thought to be universal. Africans,\nlike Europeans, believed that some evil, disasters, and illnesses were produced by witch-\ncraft. Specialists were needed to combat the power of evil and eliminate the witches. This\nled in many societies to the existence of a class of diviners or priests who guided reli-\ngious practice and helped protect the community. Above all, African religion provided\na cosmology\u2014a view of how the universe worked\u2014and a guide to \u00e9thics and behavior.\n\nMany African peoples shared an underlying belief in a creator deity whose power\nand action were expressed through spirits or. lesser gods and through the founding an-\ncestors of the group. The ancestors often were viewed as the first settlers and thus the\n\u201cowners\u201d of the land or the local resources. Through them, the fertility of the land, game,\npeople, and herds could be ensured. Among some groups, working the land took on reli-\ngious significance, so the land itself had a meaning beyond its economic usefulness.\n\nReligion, economics, and history were thus closely intertwined.

The concept that all members of the umma, or commu-\n\nnity of believers, were equal put the newly converted Berbers and later Africans on an\n\nual footing with the Arabs, at least in law. Despite these egalitarian and somewhat\n\npian ideas within Islam, practices differed considerably at local levels. Social stratifi-\n\nion remained important\u2018in Islamicized societies, and ethnic distinctions also divided\n\nbelievers. Despite certain teachings on the equality between men and women, the\n\nfine for killing a man was twice that for killing a woman.

The union of civil and supernatural powers in the person\nhe ruler was the basis of power. The highly urbanized nature of Yoruba society and the\nishing of artisan traditions within these towns bear some similarity to those of the city-\nfes of medieval Italy or Germany. The remarkable terra-cotta and bronze portrait heads\npast rulers were produced in the period after 1200 c.z. by Yoruba artists; their lifelike\nality and the skill of their execution are among the greatest achievements of African art.\nPatterns similar to those in the Yoruba city-states could be found among Edo peoples\nthe east of Yoruba.

Estimates based on fragmentary sources,\nthe amount of available resources, and analysis of agricultural\nor hunting techniques have been used as rough guesses\nabout population size. The results often are inadequate\nor controversial, but historians believe that the question\nis important. Demography, the. study of population, has\nincreasingly become a valued tool of historical inquiry. Clearly,\nunless we know the size, density, age structure, health,\nand reproductive capacity of a population, it is difficult to\nunderstand many aspects of its society, politics, and economy.\nIn the contemporary world, most nations conduct periodic\ncensuses to assess the present situation of their populations\nand to plan for the future. Before the mid-eighteenth\ncentury, when census-taking became a regular procedure,\npopulation estimates and counts were sporadic and usually\ninaccurate.

For\nmost of this history, the human population was very small\nand grew very slowly. Before agriculture was developed, the\nhunting-and-gathering economies of the world\u2019s populations\nsupported 5 million to 10 million people, if modern studies\nof such populations can be used as a guide. After about\n8000 B.c.c., when plants and animals were domesticated,\nthere was a first demographic transition as population\nbegan to increase more rapidly but still at a modest level.\nAgriculture provided a more secure and larger food supply,\nbut population concentration in villages and towns may have\nmade people more susceptible to disease and thus reduced\ntheir numbers. Other historians believe that the settled\nagricultural life also led to intensified warfare (because\nof the struggle for land and water) and increasing social\nstratification within societies.\n\nStill, the Neolithic Revolution and the development of\nagriculture stimulated population growth. It was the first\nmajor transition in the history of world population.

The center\n-of population and political power in Central Mexico shifted to the valley of Mexico and.\nespecially to the shores of the large chain of lakes in that basin. These provided a rich\naquatic environment. The shores of the lakes were dotted with settlements and towns\nand supported a dense population. Of the approximately 3,000 square miles in the basin\nof the valley, about 400 square miles were under water. The lakes became the cultural \u2014\nheartland and population center of Mexico in the postclassical period.

Whatever the religious motivations of this cult, the Aztec rulerg\nmanipulated those motivations as an effective means of political terror.

The cult of human sacri.\nfice and conquest was united with the political power of the ruler and the nobility. ;\n\n8.2 Aztec Religious and Economic\nStructure\n\nWhat were the main characteristics of Aztec society?\n\nThe Aztecs utilized many of the cultural and economic features they inherited from ear-: ;\nlier societies in the region. But they added important new elements, including a more :\nmilitaristic cultural tone and, in agriculture, a variety of new techniques. Aztec achieve-\nments were ail the more remarkable as they continued to work within an essentially \u2014\nNeolithic technological framework.\n\n8.2.1 Religion and the Ideology of Conquest\n\nAztec religion incorporated many features that had long been part of the Mesoameri-\ncan belief system. Religion was a vast, uniting, and sometimes oppressive force in which \u2014\nlittle distinction was made between the world of the gods and the natural world. The\ntraditional deities of Mesoamerica\u2014the gods of rain, fire, water, corn, the sky, and the }\nsun, many of whom had been worshiped as far back as the time of Teotihuacan\u2014were \u2014\nvenerated among the Aztecs.

Each god had at least five |\naspects, each associated with one of the cardinal directions and the center. Certain gods \u2014\nwere thought to be the patrons of specific cities, ethnic groups, or occupations.\n\nThe gods were supported by a round of yearly festivals and ceremonies that in-\nvolved feasting and dancing along with penance and sacrifice. This complex array of ~\ndeities can be organized into three major themes or cults. The first were the gods of fer-\ntility and the agricultural cycle, such as Tlaloc, the god of rain (called Chac by the Maya)\nand the gods and goddesses of water, maize, and fertility. A second group centered on ~\nthe creator deities, the great gods and goddesses who had brought the universe into be-\ning. The story of their actions played a central role in Aztec cosmography. Much Aztec\nabstract and philosophical thought was devoted to the theme of creation. Finally, the cult\u201d\nof warfare and sacrifice built on the preexisting Mesoamerican traditions that had been.\nexpanding since Toltec times and, under the militaristic Aztec state, became the cult of :\nthe state. Huitzilopochtli, the Aztec tribal patron, became the central figure of this cult.\n\nThe Aztecs revered the great traditional deities\u2014such as Tlaloc and Quetzalcoatl, an at\ncient god of civilization\u2014that were so holy to the Toltecs; but their own tribal deity, Huitzilo\npochtli, was paramount. The Aztecs identified him with the old sun god, and they saw him\nas a warrior in the daytime sky fighting to give life and warmth to the world against the a\nforces of the night.",

Warrior cults and the\n\nmilitaristic images of jaguars and eagles devouring human hearts were characteristic\nof Toltec art. The Aztecs simply took an existing tendency and carried it further. Both\nthe types and frequency of sacrifice increased, and a whole symbolism and ritual, which\nincluded cannibalism, developed as part of the cult (Figure 8.3). How much of Aztec\nsacrifice was the result of religious conviction and how much was a tactic of terror and\npolitical control by the rulers and priests is still open to debate.\n\nBeneath the surface of this polytheism, there was also a sense of spiritual unity.\nNezhualcoyotl, the king of Texcoco, wrote hymns to the \u201clord of the close vicinity,\u201d an\ninvisible creative force that supported all the gods.

In and around the lake, however, the Aztecs adopted an ingenious\nsystem of irrigated agriculture by building chinampas. These were beds of aquatic\u201d\nweeds, mud, and earth that had been placed in frames made of cane and rooted to the.\nlake floor. They formed artificial floating islands about 17 feet long and 100 to 330 feets\nwide. This narrow construction allowed the water to reach all the plants, and willow\ntrees were also planted at intervals to give shade and help fix the roots. Much of the land\nof Tenochtitlan itself was chinampa in origin, and in the southern end of the lake, more ;\nthan 20,000 acres of chinampas were constructed. The yield from chinampa agriculture\nwas high: Four cofn crops a year were possible. Apparently, this system of irrigated age\nriculture had been used in preclassical days, but a rise in the level of the lakes had made\nit impossible to continue.

Despite the importance\nof the markets, this was not a market economy as we usually understand it.\n\nThe state controlled the use and distribution of many commodities and redistributed\nthe vast amounts of tribute received from subordinate peoples. Tribute levels were as-\nsigned according to whether the subject peoples had accepted Aztec rule or had fought\nagainst it. Those who surrendered paid less. Tribute payments, such as food, slaves, and\nsacrificial victims, served political and economic ends. More than 120,000 mantles of cot-\nton cloth alone were collected as tribute each year and sent to Tenochtitlan. The Aztec\nstate redistributed these goods. After the original conquests, it rewarded its nobility\nrichly, and the commoners received far less.\n\n8.3 Aztec Society in Transition\n\nWhat were the principal strengths and constraints of the Aztec economy and social\nstructure?\n\nAs with all civilizations, Aztec society experienced changes over time. The Mexica were\none of a number of peoples who spoke the Nahuatl language and occupied the region of\ncentral Mexico.

The American Indian societies had many\nreligious ideas and practices that shocked Christian observers,\nand aspects of their social and familial arrangements clashed\nwith European sensibilities. Those sensibilities often were\ninfluenced by religious and political considerations. Many of\nthose who most condemned human sacrifice, polygamy, or\nthe despotism of Indian ruters were also those who tried to\njustify European conquest and control, mass violence, and\ntheft on a continental scale. Other European voices also were\nheard. Not long after the Spanish conquests in the sixteenth\ncentury, defenders of Indian rights came forward to argue that\ndespite certain \u201cunfortunate\u201d habits, Indian civilization was\nno less to be admired than that of the ancient (and pagan)\nRomans and Greeks.\n\nFor Western civilization, evaluating and judging non-\nWestern or past societies has always been a complex\nbusiness that has mixed elements of morality, politics, religion,\nand self-perception along with the record of what is observed\nor considered to be reality.",

At times this has led to abhorrence and\nrejection\u2014as of Aztec sacrifice\u2014but at other times it has led to\na kind of utopian romanticism in which the accomplishments\nof the Indian past are used as a critique of the present and a\u201d\nPolitical program for the future.\n\nThe existence of Inca socialism is a case in point. Some\nearly Spanish authors portrayed Inca rule as despotic, but\nothers saw it as a kind of utopia. Shortly after the conquest\nof Peru, Garcilaso de la Vega, the son of a Spaniard and an\nIndian noblewoman, wrote a glowing history of his mother\u2019s\nPeople in which he presented an image of the Inca Empire\nas a carefully organized system in which every community\nContributed to the whole, and the state regulated the\ndistribution of resources on the basis of need and reciprocity.\nThere was some truth in this view, but it ignored same aspects\n\nof exploitation as well. In the twentieth century, Peruvian\nsocialists, faced with underdevelopment and social inequality\nin their country, used this utopian view of Inca society as a\npossible model for their own future. Their interpretation and\nthat of historians who later wrote of Inca socialism tended to\nignore the hierarchy in the Inca Empire and the fact that the\nstate extracted labor and goods from the subject communities\nto support the nobles, who held extensive power.

If the modern estimates. _\nare valid, the peoples of the Americas clearly made up a major segment of humanity.\n\n8.5.2 Differing Cultural Patterns\n\nAlthough it is impossible to summarize the variety of cultural patterns and lifeways\nthat existed in the Americas on the eve of contact with Europeans, we can describe the \u2019\nmajor patterns outside the main civilization areas.

While there are a number of\nelements involved, the decline of the Mongols was a key spur. Because the rise and con-\nsolidation of the Mongol Empire had produced such profound effects in Asia and Europe,\nits gradual retreat inevitably had huge consequences. i\n\nThis chapter highlights the main changes taking shape by the early fifteenth century:\nThe principal focus is the shifting balance among civilizations in Asia, Africa, and Europe\nand how these power shifts changed the nature of international contact.\n\nThis period of transition began with the decline of Arab strength\u2014symbolized by\nthe fall of the last Arab caliphate in 1258\u2014and the disruptions that Mongol incursions\ncaused elsewhere in Asia and Eastern Europe. These developments created new op\nportunities in the Afro-Eurasian network that had been established during the previ-\nous centuries, initially under Arab sponsorship. Various candidates emerged to take\na new international leadership role once the Mongol Empire faded, including, for @\nshort time, Ming China.

Within the Middle East itself, Arab and then Mongol decline created new\n4 portunities for Turkish conquerors and migrants. In 1453 the Ottoman Turks cap-\ntured Constantinople, effectively completing the destruction of the Byzantine Empire\nand creating a new Islamic political power. The Ottomans quickly established control\naround much of the Black Sea, including the Balkans, and began to push southward\njnto Arab lands.\n\nWhile the Ottomans would play some role in transregional trade, the most dy-\nnamic new contender for leadership ultimately proved to be Western Europe; the con-\nditions that propelled Western civilization into this new position around 1400 form\nthe second key theme of this chapter. The West was not yet a major power; it did not\nreplace the Arabs or Chinese as international leaders quickly or easily. The first stages\nof the rise of the West were accompanied by important changes in Western civiliza-\ntion itself, which were beginning to take shape by 1400. At this point, Italy, Spain, and\nPortugal took the lead in Western European outreach, a lead that they would hold for\nabout two centuries.\n\nIt is also vital to note changes in societies outside the international network, in\nthe Americas and Polynesia. New difficulties in the great American empires, in partic-\nular, would reduce their ability to respond to the challenge of contact with Europeans\nafter 1492.\n\nFocusing on new frameworks for international contacts, this chapter inevitably deals\nwith the question of why individual societies reacted differently to key forces. Compar-\nison is essential. Western Europe\u2019s response, for example, should be compared to reac-\ntions at the same time in regions like Japan or sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nAmid variations and great change, the transitions around 1450 highlighted one im-\nportant continuity as well: the importance of the level of contacts that had developed\nthrough the formation of the transcontinental network.

Developments occurred in various aspects of }\nsociety, and some of them are not easy to explain. y\nCulture shifted, along with politics, in this crucial region. An earlier tension in phi-\nlosophy and the arts yielded to the predominance of the Islamic faith. The new Piety \u2014\nassociated with the rising Sufi movement, discussed in Chapter 5, contributed to a ney\nreligious emphasis. In literature, attention to secular themes, such as the joys of feasting\u201d\nand hunting, gave way to more strictly religious ideas. The same shift occurred in phi\nlosophy, with new attacks on the idea of combining faith with reason. Thus Al-Ghazali\nin a book revealingly titled The Destruction of the Philosophers, claimed. to use Aristotle's\u2019\nlogic to show that it was imposible to discover religious truth by human reason. Many =\nSufi scholars wrote excitedly of their mystical contacts with God and the stages of their\nreligious passion. Islamic science continued, but its role diminished. q\nChanges in society and the economy were as telling as the shifts in politics and in:\ntellectual life. As the authority of the caliphate declined, landlords seized power over th\npeasantry. As a result, from about 1100 onward, Middle Eastern peasants increasingly lost _\ntheir freedom, becoming serfs on large estates, providing the labor and produce landlords \u2014\nsought. This loss was not the peasants\u2019 alone, for agricultural productivity suffered as a re-\nsult. Landlords turned to sucking what they could from their estates rather than trying to\ndevelop a more vital agriculture. Tax revenues declined, and Arab and other Middle Eastern\ntraders began to lose ground. Few Arab coins have been found in Europe dating from later i\nthan 1100. European merchants began to control their own turf and challenge the Arabs in\n:\n|\n|\n\nother parts of the Mediterranean, gaining increasing initiative in this vital trading area.\n\nArab decline was gradual and incomplete.

The reduced dynamism in trade did not\ntake the Arabs out of major world markets, for example. Indeed, Middle Eastern com-\nmerce rebounded somewhat by 1400.\n\nFinally, the political fragmentation of the Arab world did not produce prolonged\nconfusion in the Middle East or in the religion of Islam. The emerging Ottoman Turk\nish state soon mastered many of the lands of the old caliphate as well as the Byzantine\ncorner, expanding into Southeastern Europe. The new empire gave renewed vitality to\nIslamic politics, and it would soon be joined by two other Islamic empires, in Persia and\nIndia. (See Chapter 15 for the development of the Ottoman Empire.) It is important to\nrealize that the empire was far more powerful, politically and militarily, than the caliph-\nate had been for many centuries. It was thus more challenging to rivals in neighboring\ncivilizations such as Western Europe or Russia.\n\n9.2 The Structure of Transregional Trade\n\nWhat caused the Chinese decision to abandon major expeditions?\n\nEven the rise of the Ottoman Empire would not restore the full international vigor that\nthe Islamic caliphate had wielded had at the height of its powers. The empire did not be\ncome the sole hub of an international network, as the caliphate had been a few centuries\nbefore. By the fifteenth century, merchants from many societies were competing for roles\nin transregional trade. In the Mediterranean, Europe, and particularly Italy, merchants\nwere increasingly active. In the Indian Ocean, merchants from India and Southeast Asia,\nmost of them Muslims, rivaled Arab activity.\n\nThe big issue in the fifteenth century, however, involved the aftermath of the Mongol\nera.

Essentially, this Mongol system had replaced earlier\nArab leadership in facilitating transregional trade. But the Mongol defeat in China, late\nin the fourteenth century, and new pressure on Mongol rulers in Russia and elsewhere\nunraveled this system. Overland travel became more difficult and dangerous without\nMongol political protection. Trade and its motivations did not diminish in importance,\nput inevitably new emphasis focused on seagoing routes, particularly in the Indian\nOcean. Two societies, first China and then Europe, sought to take advantage of the op-\n\nportunities involved.\n\n9.2.1 Chinese Outreach and Reconsideration\n\nFor a brief time China asserted new leadership in international trade. This activity\nreflected earlier gains in Chinese shipping, and China\u2019s long-standing focus on manufac-\nturing for export. Rebellions in China drove out the deeply resented Mongol overlords\nin 1368. A rebel leader from a peasant family, Zhu Yuanzhang (joo wan-jang), seized the\nMongol capital of Beijing and proclaimed a new Ming\u2014meaning \u201cbrilliant\u2019\u201d\u2014dynasty\nthat was to last until 1644. The dynasty began with a burst of unusual expansionism.\nThe initial Ming rulers pressed to secure the borders of the Middle Kingdom. This meant\npushing the Mongols far to the north, to the plains of what is now Mongolia. It meant rees-\ntablishing influence over neighboring governments and winning tribute payments from\nstates in Korea, Vietnam, and Tibet, reviving much of the East Asian regional structure set\nup by the Tang dynasty. Far more unusual was a new policy, adopted soon after 1400, of\nmounting huge, state-sponsored trading expeditions to Southern Asia and beyond.",

Later voyages\nreached the Middle East and the eastern coast of Africa, bringing chinaware and copper\ncoinage in exchange for local goods. Chinese shipping at its height consisted of 2,700\ncoastal vessels, 400 armed naval ships, and at least as many long-distance ships. Nine\ngreat treasure ships, the most sophisticated in the world at the time, explored the Indian\nOcean, the Persian Gulf, and the Red Sea, establishing trade connections but also seeking\ntribute payments all along the way.\n\nBetween 1405 and their termination in 1433, these expeditions were commanded by the\nadmiral Zheng He. A Muslim from Western China, Zheng He was well suited to deal with\nMuslims in Southeast Asia on the Indian Ocean trade route. Zheng He was also a eunuch,\ncastrated for service at the royal court. China\u2019s Ming emperors retained a large harem of\nwives to ensure succession, and eunuchs were needed to guard them without threat of sex-\nual rivalry; many gained bureaucratic powers well beyond this service.

What are\nthe principal interpretations?\n\n|\n)\nThe West\u2019s gradual emergence into larger world contacts during the fifteenth century t\nwas surprising in many respects. Western expansion had numerous causes, and it must i\nbe seen as a result of growing problems as well as new strengths. }\n\nWesterners remained awed by the powerful bureaucracies and opulent treasuries of\nempires in the traditional civilization centers such as Constantinople. Furthermore, the\nWest was changing in some painful ways. Key features of medieval culture and society\nwere being questioned by 1400. The church, which had long been one of the organiz-\ning institutions of Western civilization, was under new attack. Medieval philosophy had )\npassed its creative phase. Warrior aristocrats, long a key leadership group in feudal so- t\nciety, softened their style of life, preferring court rituals and jousting tournaments and\nadopting military armor so cumbersome that real fighting was difficult.\n\nEven more strikingly, the lives and economic activities of ordinary Europeans were in\ndisarray. This was a time of crisis, and Europe\u2019s expanding world role could not reverse the\nfundamental challenges to its internal economic and demographic structure.

A very great number\nof the saintly sisters of the H\u00e9tel-Dieu who, not fearing\nto die, nursed the sick in all sweetness and humility,\nwith no thought of honor, a number too often renewed\nby death, rest in peace with Christ, as we may piously\nbelieve.\n\nSome sai\u00a2 that this pestilence was caused by infec-\ntion of the air and waters, since there was at this time no\nfamine nor lack of food supplies, but on the contrary great\nabundance. As a result of this theory of infected water\nand air as the source of the Plague the Jews were sud-\ndenly and violently charged with infecting wells and water\nand corrupting the air.

Artists and writers _\nbecame more openly ambitious for personal reputation and glory.

The subject matter of art\nmoved toward nature and people, including cityscapes and portraits of the rich and pow-\nerful, whether the themes were religious or secular. Florentine painter Giotto (gee-YAW-\ntoh) led the way, departing from medieval formalism and stiffness. While still a young\napprentice to the painter Cimabue (chee-mah-BOO-eh), Giotto painted a fly on the nose\nof one of Cimabue\u2019s portrait subjects, and it was so realistic that Cimabue repeatedly\ntried to swat it off before going back to work on the canvas. Other painters, beginning\nlater in the fourteenth century, started to introduce perspective while using new colors\nand other materials. In architecture, favor shifted away from the Gothic to a classicism\nderived from the styles of Greece and Rome. Vivid, realistic statues complemented the\new palaces and public buildings. 4\n\nThe impact of the early Renaissance must not be exaggerated. It had little influence\nOutside of Italy. Even in Italy, it focused on high culture, not popular culture, and on the\narts; there was little initial interest in science. And although it built on distinctive political\nand economic forms, it was not a full break from medieval tendencies.\n\nNevertheless, these new cultural currents were an important innovation in West-\nem history. The full ramifications of the Renaissance feed into the next period of both\nworld and Western history (see Chapter 11). The movement was only getting started\nby 1400.

Soon after 1400, major regional monarchies had, i\nbeen established in the provinces of Castile and Aragon, which would be united throug\nroyal marriage in 1469. .\n\nEven before the marriage between Ferdinand and Isabella, Spanish and Por-\ntuguese rulers had developed a vigorous military and religious agenda. They sup- \u2014\nported effective armies, including infantry and noble cavalry. And they believed\nthat government had a mission to promote Christianity by converting or expelling \u2014 4\nArabs and Jews and by maintaining doctrinal purity within the church. Close links ;\nbetween church and state, portrayed in art, provided revenues and officials for the \u2014\nroyal government. In return, the government supported church courts in their efforts\nto enforce moral and doctrinal purity. Later in the fifteenth century, this interaction \u2014\nled to the reestablishment of the church-run courts of the Inquisition in Spain, de-\nsigned to enforce religious orthodoxy. In other words, Spain and Portugal were de-\nveloping effective new governments with a special sense of religious mission and\nreligious support. These changes most directly promoted the West's expansion into\nwider world contacts.\n\n9.3.6 The First Phases of Western Expansion\n\nAs early as 1291, two Italian brothers, the Vivaldis from Genoa, sailed with two galleys\nthrough the Straits of Gibraltar, seeking a western route to the \u201cIndies,\u201d the\nspice-producing areas of South and Southeast Asia.

These islands had been known vaguely since clas-\nsical times but had never been explored by Europeans. Genoese sailors also visited the\nMadeiras and probably reached the more distant Azores by 1351. Soon after this, ships\nfrom Northeastern Spain, based in the port of Barcelona, sailed along the African coast a8\nfar south as present-day Sierra Leone.\n\nUntil 1430, technological barriers prevented further exploration for alternative\nroutes. Without adequate navigation instruments, Europeans could not risk wider\nventures into the Atlantic. They also needed better ships than the shallow-drafted,\noar-propelled Mediterranean galleys. However, efforts were underway to develop au\noceangoing sailing vessel.
